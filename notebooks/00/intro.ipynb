    "This course intentiaonally avoids advanced deep learning topics. This is mainly to not overlap with the dedicated deep learning course at UiT [FYS-3033 Deep Learning](https://en.uit.no/education/courses/course?p_document_id=859747). However, the foundation of deep learning (neural networks) is introduced from first principles. We go all the way from the Perceptron to mulitlayer perceptrons, coding everything from scratch. That means, those who follow this course will have a fundamental understanding of how neural networks work. Then, the dedicated deep learning course expands on this to cover the fundamental and most recent topics within the field of deep learning.\n"
